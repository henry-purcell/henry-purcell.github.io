Note about the edition:  

This edition supersedes the original Purcell Society Edition Vol. 19 edited by Edward J. Dent, published by Novello & Co. in 1912. The original Vol. 19 contained, in addition to The Indian Queen, music for The Tempest which was then attributed to Purcell but which is now believed to be the work of John Weldon.
