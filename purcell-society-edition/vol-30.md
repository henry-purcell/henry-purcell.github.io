Purcell Society Edition Volume 30 contains the following works by Purcell:  

Ah! Few And Full Of Sorrow  
Awake And Attention Hear  
Awake Ye Dead  
Begin Of The Song  
Close Thine Eyes  
Early, O Lord, My Fainting Soul  
Full Of Wrath, His Threat’ning Breath  
Great God, And Just  
Hear Me, O Lord, The Great Support  
Hosanna To The Highest  
How Have I Stray’d  
How Long, Great God  
In The Black, Dismal Dungeon Of Despair  
It Must Be Done, My Soul  
Let The Night Perish  
Lord, I Can Suffer  
Lord, Not To Us  
Lord, What Is Man, Lost Man  
Now That The Sun Hath Veil’d His Light  
O All Ye People, Clap Your Hands  
O Happy Man  
O Lord Our Governor  
O Lord, Since I Experienc’d Have  
O, I’m Sick Of Life  
Plung’d In The Confines Of Despair  
Since God So Tender A Regard  
Sleep, Adam, Sleep, And Take Thy Rest  
Tell Me, Some Pitying Angel  
The Earth Trembled  
Thou Wakeful Shepherd  
We Sing To Him, Whose Wisdom  
When On My Sick Bed I Languish  
With Sick And Famish’d Eyes
