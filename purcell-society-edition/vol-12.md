Note about the edition:  

This completely new edition supersedes the original Purcell Society Edition Vol. 12 edited by J.S. Shedlock and published by Novello & Co. in 1903, and the edition by Antony Lewis published by Novello & Co. in 1968. The Stainer & Bell edition provides a new and definitive version of the words and music. The playtext is printed in full, with a thorough reappraisal of the sources of the text, both printed and manuscript. The examination of the musical sources includes music manuscripts which have not previously been studied and which prove to have a significant bearing on the musical text.
