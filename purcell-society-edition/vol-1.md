Note about the edition:  

This completely new edition supersedes the original Purcell Society Edition Vol. 1 edited by W.H. Cummings and published by Novello and Ewer in 1868, which contained the Yorkshire Feast Song only. The new Volume 1 also provides brand new editions of Celestial Music and Great Parent, hail! to replace those published in 1957 in Purcell Society Edition Vol. 27 (Miscellaneous Odes and Cantatas). That volume has now been replaced by a new Vol. 27 containing Symphony Songs.
